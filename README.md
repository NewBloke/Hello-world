# Hello-world
An old dog learning new tricks in the world of code.
I've spent most of my working life in the military and am now working toward transitioning into a new career. As such I just completed a Masters of Business, during which I became increasingly interested in the tech and startups. Now I'm chosing to learn about these sectors by getting directly involved.
